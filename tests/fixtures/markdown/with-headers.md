# Main Title

Introduction paragraph with enough content for chunking. This section provides
context about the document and what it contains.

## Section One

Content under section one. This section discusses important topics
that need to be chunked appropriately for vector search.

The chunker should recognize markdown structure and maintain proper
context boundaries when splitting the document.

### Subsection 1.1

Detailed content in subsection. The chunker should recognize
markdown structure and split at appropriate boundaries.

This subsection contains specific details that should be kept
together during the chunking process.

## Section Two

Another section with different content. Testing how the splitter
handles multiple sections and maintains context through overlap.

The overlap between chunks ensures that context is not lost
when documents are split for embedding generation.

### Subsection 2.1

More detailed content here. Each subsection should be chunked
in a way that preserves the hierarchical structure.

## Conclusion

Final section wrapping up the document. This tests how the
chunker handles the end of the document.
